# Florin County Council Community Hub

Florin County Council community hub is a space that is; open and accessible to the local community; providing services that the local community wants and needs; where formal decisions about running and managing the hub are taken by people who come mainly from within the local community.

## Project Description
The aim of this project is to create a community website with the aim of allowing members & businesses in Florin County to:

- Post jobs/volunteering opportunities
- Reduce overflow in the local recycling centre by creating a marketplace for items that can be reused and read information on reusable products
- Post clubs and learning opportunities
- Post events
